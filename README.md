# US Honey consumption : Clustering

I used US Honey Consumption dataset to find answers of following questions:



1. State with highest stocks

2. State with highest colonies number

3. State with highest production

4. State with highest yield per colony

5. Top 5 states with highest production

6. Top 5 states with highest value of production

7. Year with highest mean average price

8. Year with highest mean production

9. Year with cheapest mean average price

10. Year with highest average price

11. Distribution of production yearwise

12. State with highest colonies



I played with this dataset, and found that this dataset is clusterable by hopkins test. I learned something that was interesting for me from this clustering.
